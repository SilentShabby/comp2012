## Basic Knowledge

- const to the left of the ∗ &rArr; pointer to const  
  const to the right of the ∗ &rArr; const pointer

  (read from right to left)

## Constructor and Destructor

- Brace initializer {} : if data members are **all public**

  ```c++
  class Word { public: int frequency; const char* str; };
  Word movie = {1, "Titanic"};
  ```

- A default constructor is automatically supplied only when **no user-defined constructors** are found!

  ```c++
  //Word;			// Compilation Error: declaration does not declare anything
  Word();			// initialization with default constructor, POOR GUY
  Word w;			// initialization with default constructor
  Word w0();		// function declaration with name "w0" and return type Word
  Word w1{};		// initialization with default constructor
  //w0.print();	// Compilation Error: request for member 'print' in 'w0', which is of non-class type 'Word ()'
  ```

- A conversion constructor is a constructor accepting a **single argument**,

  or all but one argument have default values.

  ```c++
  explicit Word(const char* s) { ... } // to disallow implicit conversion
  Word movie0 {’A’}; // Explicit conversion
  Word movie1 = ’B’; // Implicit conversion: Error!
  ```

- A copy constructor X::X(const X& ) is called when:

  - parameter passed by value
  - object returned by value
  - initialization using the assignment syntax (e.g. Word y = x;)

  default: memberwise copy by calling the copy constructor of each data member

  C.f. memberwise assignment: calling the assignment operator= of each data member

  ```c++
  void Bug(Word& x) { Word bug("bug", 4); x = bug; } // memory leak of x (movie)
  int main() {
      Word movie {"Titanic"};
      Bug(movie);	// memory leak of movie; and the Word{"bug", 4} is deleted right afterwards
      return 0;	// ~Word() cannot delete dangling pointer
  }
  ```

- A parameter can have its default argument specified only once (usually in header, not in definition)!

- **const or reference members** must be initialized using member initialization list!  
  It cannot be done using default arguments!

- The default destructor simply releases the memory in stack!

- To explicitly generate or not generate a constructor/destructor: = default; = delete;

- Order of construction/destruction:

  1. base class

  2. data members (in the order of that they're declared)

     ```c++
     class Word_Pair { 
     private: Word w1; Word w2;
     public: Word_Pair(const char* s1, const char* s2) : w2(s2), w1(s1,5) {} };
     // w1 is created first, and then w2
     ```

  3. itself

  Destruction: in the reverse order (use delete properly in the destructors!)

## Inheritance

- Constructors and destructors are never inherited

- Access:

  - public: everything
  - protected: member functions and friends of **the class and derived classes**
  - private: member functions and friends of **the class**

- Slicing: only for **public inheritance**

  ```c++
  Base base;
  base = derived; 	// Slicing
  cout << typeid(base).name() << endl; // the derived becomes a base

  Base b = derived;	// Initializing with copy constructor
  Base* b = &derived; // Can't use derived-class specific members
  Base& b = derived;	// Can't use derived-class specific members

  // The following assignments give compilation errors:
  //derived = base;		// Unless it's user-defined
  //Derived* d = &base; 	// No such conversion!
  //Derived& d = base;	// No such conversion!
  ```

- virtual

  - member functions: virtual in the base class, virtual in all derived classes

  - destructor: virtual only in the base class

  - pure virtual functions: only in an abstract base class

  - dynamic binding: only works on a **pointer or reference**

    ```c++
    class A { public: virtual void f() { cout << "func in A" << endl; } };
    class B : public A { private: virtual void f() { cout << "func in B" << endl; } };

    int main() {
        B bObj;
        //bObj.f(); 	// Error. Since func() in B is private
        A& aRef = bObj; // Liscov substitution principle
        
        aRef.f(); 	// We can call func() in B via dynamic binding, even it is private
        // Type of aRef is A, so we should first reach func() in A
        // f() in A is virtual, so we check and find the object aRef refers to is B type
        // f() in B is called, despite that it's private
    }
    ```

  - dynamic_cast\<Class_Name*>(ptr_or_ref)  only works on pointers and references of polymorphic
    class (with virtual functions) types

- Abstract Base Class (ABC)

  - No objects of ABC can be created
  - Its derived classes must implement the pure virtual functions, otherwise they will also be ABCs
  - cannot be used as:
    - argument type that is passed by value
    - return type that is returned by value
    - type of an explicit conversion

- final

  ```c++
  class Student final : public UPerson { // No sub-classes can be derived from a final class
  	public: /* Other data and functions */
      // a final virtual function can't be override any more
  	virtual void print() const override final {} 
  };
  ```
